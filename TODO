* merge alignpostings from financial machine as alignpostings-cli
* rename sortpostigns to sortpostings-cli
* enhance parser so that sortpostings-cli and alignpostings-cli
  can use the parser instead of regexps instead
* add tests for sortpostings-cli and alignpostings-cli
* make parsegmob output the transactions where the a/r accrual happens
* figure out where to store bal, reg, and parsegmob, and parsemypay somewhere
  perhaps they should be more than just scripts in the financial vm
